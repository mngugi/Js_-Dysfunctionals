  <script>
    Set-Cookie; sessionsid=122355665656994466979332352656598956563262; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict;
   
    Set-Cookie; sessionsid=122355665656994466979332352656598956563262; SameSite=Strict;

   <p><b>Using HttpOnly Cookies:</b>Cookies that are used to store sensitive<br>
    information like session IDs should be marked with the HttpOnly flag.<br>
    This ensures that they cannot be accessed via client-side JavaScript <br>
    and are only sent with HTTP requests.</p>

    <p><b>Using SameSite Attribute:</b>The SameSite attribute prevents the browser<br>
        from sending this cookie along with cross-site requests, which helps prevent<br>
         Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. </p>
