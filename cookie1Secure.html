   <p><b>Using HttpOnly Cookies:</b>Cookies that are used to store sensitive 
    information like session IDs should be marked with the HttpOnly flag.
    This ensures that they cannot be accessed via client-side JavaScript 
    and are only sent with HTTP requests.</p>

    <p><b>Using SameSite Attribute:</b>The SameSite attribute prevents the browser
        from sending this cookie along with cross-site requests, which helps prevent
         Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. </p>
